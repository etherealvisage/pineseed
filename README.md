### Pineseed platformer game

Pineseed (working codename) is intended to be a 2D platformer adventure game.
Unlike most such games, however, Pineseed is being designed with a specific
focus on de-escalation and on 'conversational combat', where you face down
mighty enemies threatening the local area with . . . your words and your wits.

Pineseed is currently under development as the authors spend some of their free
time working on creating both the story as well as the engine.

### System requirements

Pineseed is not a particularly resource-intensive game, and as such will
probably run on anything that the game engine,
[Kriti](https://github.com/etherealvisage/kriti), operates on. No support for
mobile platforms is currently planned, though it is an option that the authors
are discussing.
